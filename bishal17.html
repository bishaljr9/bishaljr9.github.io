<p> there are lots of people who have been bullies they wanted to help out each other becasue they know whats happen if you et bullies </p>
<p>people in society should help out those other too and teach other not to do that so other can learn it do something new that made society proud</p>
<p>other big people bullies kids ask them to bring money and other stuff but they should show love to kids because if they get scared in their childhood life they can be like that forever and every family member should teach them about this</p>
