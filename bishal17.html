<p>bullys mean hurting people and making fun of their look, if someone did that kind of think then the person who is bullied will get scared</p>
<p>it hurt people when something happen with them like being mean making fun of the dress they wear the way they look if someone bullied to each other the person who is bullied will try to attempt a suicide mostly youth dies the most commiting suicide</p>
<p>every youth of today genreation should learn about the bulllies because it had taken some of the others life so they will be next in a time</p>
<p> there are lots of people who have been bullies they wanted to help out each other becasue they know whats happen if you et bullies </p>
<p>people in society should help out those other too and teach other not to do that so other can learn it do something new that made society proud</p>
<p>other big people bullies kids ask them to bring money and other stuff but they should show love to kids because if they get scared in their childhood life they can be like that forever and every family member should teach them about this</p>
<p> for example milan was from nepal he didn't knew anything about USA when he first came here he was alone with family members he had no friends </p>
<p>he went to elemenetry school at that time he had lots of probelm in his life like he was bullied so many times in life because he was a small guy in school he was new in this country  </p>
